# Abstract: The increasing popularity of digital twins, alongside the rapid evolution of connectivity driven by the Internet of Things, highlights their potential to greatly aid in the development of smart cities. Digital twins are employed more commonly as smart cities grow and societies become more interconnected. With the growing need for this technology, there is a pressing demand for the automatic captioning of security events from the videos collected from these models. This is needed as Dtwin models generate a lot of data that makes it difficult to caption them manually. This is required for extracting rich and meaningful higher-level interpretations from images and videos. Current models often lack in-depth insights into these complex urban systems. Additionally, there is a need for a model that can interpret and explain images and videos effectively, leveraging a combination of machine learning and knowledge graph approaches. Therefore, in this paper, we developed the Digital Twin for the buildings and road network of the TEC (Tecnologico De Monterrey) district region and additionally developed the Knowledge Graph models for emulating security events with dense video captioning. This is done by designing an AI-based TEC District Digital Twin for emulating security events by leveraging knowledge graph. The proposed approach provides data and insights about the district’s operations and security. This initiative will help district planners and managers to make better decisions by analyzing the real-time data. This is supposed to contribute to increased effectiveness of district services, transparency, and an efficient infrastructure.

# Abstract
Lateral Movement (LM) is one of the core stages of advanced persistent threats which continues to compromise the security posture of enterprise networks at large.
Recent research work have employed Graph Neural Network (GNN) techniques to detect LM in intricate networks. Such approaches employ transductive graph learning, where fixed graphs with full nodes’ visibility are employed in the training phase, along with ingesting benign data. These two assumptions in real-world setups (i) do not take into consideration the evolving nature of enterprise networks where dynamic features and connectivity prevail among hosts, users, virtualized environments, and applications, and (ii) hinder the effectiveness of detecting LM by solely training on normal data, especially given the evasive, stealthy, and benign-like behaviors of contemporary malicious maneuvers. Additionally, (iii) complex networks typically do not have the entire visibility of their run-time network processes, and if they do, they often fall short in dynamically tracking LM due to latency issues with passive data analysis. To this end, this paper proposes Jbeil, a data-driven
framework for self-supervised deep learning on evolving networks represented as sequences of authentication timed events. The premise of the work lies in applying an encoder on a continuous-time evolving graph to produce the embedding of the visible graph nodes for each time epoch, and a decoder that
leverages these embeddings to perform LM link prediction on unseen nodes. Additionally, we enclose a threat sample augmentation mechanism within Jbeil to ensure a well-informed notion on advanced LM attacks. We evaluate Jbeil using authentication timed events from the Los Alamos network which achieves an AUC score of 99.73% and a recall score of 99.25% in predicting LM paths, even when 30% of the nodes/edges are not present in the training phase. Additionally, we assess different realistic attack scenarios and demonstrate the potential of Jbeil in predicting LM paths with an AUC score of 99% in its inductive and transductive settings, out performing the state-of-the-art by a significant margin..
