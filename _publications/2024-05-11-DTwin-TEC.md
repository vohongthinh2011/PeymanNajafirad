# Abstract: The increasing popularity of digital twins, alongside the rapid evolution of connectivity driven by the Internet of Things, highlights their potential to greatly aid in the development of smart cities. Digital twins are employed more commonly as smart cities grow and societies become more interconnected. With the growing need for this technology, there is a pressing demand for the automatic captioning of security events from the videos collected from these models. This is needed as Dtwin models generate a lot of data that makes it difficult to caption them manually. This is required for extracting rich and meaningful higher-level interpretations from images and videos. Current models often lack in-depth insights into these complex urban systems. Additionally, there is a need for a model that can interpret and explain images and videos effectively, leveraging a combination of machine learning and knowledge graph approaches. Therefore, in this paper, we developed the Digital Twin for the buildings and road network of the TEC (Tecnologico De Monterrey) district region and additionally developed the Knowledge Graph models for emulating security events with dense video captioning. This is done by designing an AI-based TEC District Digital Twin for emulating security events by leveraging knowledge graph. The proposed approach provides data and insights about the district’s operations and security. This initiative will help district planners and managers to make better decisions by analyzing the real-time data. This is supposed to contribute to increased effectiveness of district services, transparency, and an efficient infrastructure.

# Abstract
The increasing popularity of digital twins, alongside the rapid evolution of connectivity driven by the Internet of Things, highlights their potential to greatly aid in the development of smart cities. Digital twins are employed more commonly as smart cities grow and societies become more interconnected. With the growing need for this technology, there is a pressing demand for the automatic captioning of security events from the videos collected from these models. This is needed as Dtwin models generate a lot of data that makes it difficult to caption them manually. This is required for extracting rich and meaningful higher-level interpretations from images and videos. Current models often lack in-depth insights into these complex urban systems. Additionally, there is a need for a model that can interpret and explain images and videos effectively, leveraging a combination of machine learning and knowledge graph approaches. Therefore, in this paper, we developed the Digital Twin for the buildings and road network of the TEC (Tecnologico De Monterrey) district region and additionally developed the Knowledge Graph models for emulating security events with dense video captioning. This is done by designing an AI-based TEC District Digital Twin for emulating security events by leveraging knowledge graph. The proposed approach provides data and insights about the district’s operations and security. This initiative will help district planners and managers to make better decisions by analyzing the real-time data.
